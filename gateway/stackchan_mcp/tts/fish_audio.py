"""Fish Audio engine — HTTP client for the hosted Fish Audio TTS API.

Fish Audio (https://fish.audio) is a hosted text-to-speech service with
strong English voices and user-trainable voice models, which makes it a
practical alternative to VOICEVOX (Japanese-only by default) for English
deployments.

Unlike the Irodori and Edge TTS engines, this one needs **no audio
decoder**: the Fish Audio API can return 16-bit mono PCM/WAV at a caller-
chosen sample rate, and 16 kHz is one of the supported rates — exactly
what the device's Opus decoder expects. The engine therefore requests
audio at :data:`~stackchan_mcp.tts.audio_utils.DEVICE_SAMPLE_RATE`
directly and hands the PCM to the orchestrator without resampling in the
common case. That keeps this engine on the base ``[tts]`` extra (httpx +
opuslib) with no extra dependency of its own — no ``miniaudio`` (Irodori)
and no ``ffmpeg`` (Edge TTS).

``mp3`` and ``opus`` response formats are deliberately *not* supported:
consuming them would drag in a decoder purely to undo an encode we never
needed.

API contract (https://docs.fish.audio, ``POST /v1/tts``)::

    POST https://api.fish.audio/v1/tts
    Authorization: Bearer <api key>
    Content-Type: application/json
    model: <backend>            # s1 | s2-pro | s2.1-pro | s2.1-pro-free

    {
        "text": "...",

        "format": "pcm" | "wav",
        "sample_rate": 16000,
        "normalize": true,
        "latency": "normal" | "balanced" | "low"
    }

    -> 200  raw audio bytes (Transfer-Encoding: chunked)
       401  JSON {"status", "message"}  — bad / missing API key
       402  JSON {"status", "message"}  — out of credit

Configuration (environment variables):

    ``STACKCHAN_FISH_AUDIO_KEY``
        API key, sent as ``Authorization: Bearer <key>``. **Required** —
        synthesis fails with a clear error when unset. Read from the
        environment only; never commit it.

    ``STACKCHAN_FISH_AUDIO_MODEL``
        Default voice model ID (the API's ``reference_id``), i.e. the
        voice to speak in. Optional: when unset the request omits
        ``reference_id`` and Fish Audio uses its own default voice.

    ``STACKCHAN_FISH_AUDIO_BACKEND``
        Synthesis backend, sent as the ``model`` HTTP header. Default
        :data:`DEFAULT_FISH_AUDIO_BACKEND`.

    ``STACKCHAN_FISH_AUDIO_URL``
        Endpoint override. Default :data:`DEFAULT_FISH_AUDIO_URL`. Useful
        for a proxy or a self-hosted compatible deployment.
